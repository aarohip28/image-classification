## 📚 Overview
The goal of this project is to implement an image classification model that can accurately categorize images into predefined classes. The process involves data preprocessing, model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and testing.​

## 🧰 Features
Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset, including resizing images, normalization, data augmentation, and splitting into training and validation sets.

Model Architecture: Choose an appropriate deep learning model architecture for image classification. Popular choices include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet.

Model Compilation: Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.

Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset using the compiled settings.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset and adjust parameters as necessary.

Model Testing: Test the final model on unseen data to assess its generalization capabilities.​

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
